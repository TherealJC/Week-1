# Week-1
Jamie Crowther  
This is where the info written at the TOP (ReadMe) area of VSCode appears  
The double spacing works, it creates a new line, but I had to do git push origin branch and then merge on Github, so now I will try merging just in vscode.  
Attempt to merge in vscode.  
Merge master with commited branch change  
Attempt 2 master to branch merge  
YES, Finally I have figured out how to create a branch, make changes, and then merge it back to master using vscode (I think) but I am not sure of the proper way when working with others, when is a pull request neccesary ? When someone else is in control of the github?
